<h1>Binary Numbers:</h1>
<p>Numbers that doesn’t exceed 0 and 1</p>
example : 4+7 = 100 + 111 = 01011

<h1>K-Map’s:</h1>
<p>Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps) are a visual tool used to simplify Boolean expressions, which are used in digital logic design.</p>
<p>The  way they work is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Display: A K-Map is a 2D grid where each cell represents a possible combination of input values.</li>
<li>Variables on Axes: You assign the variables of the Boolean expression to the axes of the grid.</li>
<li>Input Combinations: Each cell in the grid corresponds to a unique combination of input values for the variables.</li>
<li>Simplifying Expressions: By filling in the grid with the output values for each combination, you can easily see patterns and simplify the Boolean expression.</li>
</ul>
